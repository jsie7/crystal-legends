## 2026-08-09 — Keep Crystal Legends isolated from reference builds

Crystal Legends uses the dedicated `make crystallegends` target and the
`_CRYSTALLEGENDS` assembly flag on top of `_CRYSTAL11`. Project-specific code,
data, dialogue, and graphics must remain conditional so `make crystal11` and
`make compare` continue to reproduce the upstream reference ROMs exactly.

This keeps regression evidence meaningful and avoids turning intentional fork
changes into unexplained reference-ROM mismatches.

## 2026-08-09 — Defer the v0.1 emulator matrix until the cheat menu

Treat v0.1 as implementation-complete after its clean custom build, static
checks, and reference-ROM comparison pass. Defer the full three-starter
emulator matrix until the optional cheat/debug menu is implemented, then run
the v0.1 and cheat-menu acceptance checks together.

Build and source-level validation are still required while work continues.
Do not describe v0.1 as playtest-certified or release-ready until the deferred
matrix has passed.
