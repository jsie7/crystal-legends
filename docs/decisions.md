# Decisions

Record durable technical or policy decisions here.

For each entry, capture the decision, the reasoning, and any context that matters later.

## 2026-08-09 — Keep Crystal Legends isolated from reference builds

Crystal Legends uses the dedicated `make crystallegends` target and the
`_CRYSTALLEGENDS` assembly flag on top of `_CRYSTAL11`. Project-specific code,
data, dialogue, and graphics must remain conditional so `make crystal11` and
`make compare` continue to reproduce the upstream reference ROMs exactly.

This keeps regression evidence meaningful and avoids turning intentional fork
changes into unexplained reference-ROM mismatches.

## 2026-08-09 — Use native single-player evolution paths

In Crystal Legends, Kadabra, Machoke, Graveler, and Haunter evolve at level 36.
Poliwhirl, Slowpoke, Onix, Scyther, Seadra, and Porygon evolve by directly using
their canonical trade item. King's Rock, Metal Coat, Dragon Scale, and Up-Grade
remain valid held items and are renewable from Celadon Department Store 4F.

Reuse `EVOLVE_LEVEL`, `EVOLVE_ITEM`, and `EvoStoneEffect`; do not add an
evolution type, parser branch, mart ID, or save field. Keep the stock trade
records and item behavior in every reference build.

## 2026-08-09 — Reserve ordinary missing families for the Safari Zone

Mareep, Vulpix, Mankey, Girafarig, and Remoraid and their dependent evolutions
belong to the Phase 9 unattended Safari Zone. The canonical acquisition ledger
must identify the reservation now, but the exact Safari area, level, encounter
rate, and slot remain TBD until Phase 9. Phase 2 must not add substitute Johto
encounters for these families.

## 2026-08-09 — Activate and harden the native Celebi sequence

Crystal Legends awards the GS Ball once after Hall of Fame instead of relying
on mobile-event data. It retains Kurt's native inspection and waiting sequence.
A full Key Items pocket must not advance the event, and any non-capture result
at the shrine restores the GS Ball plus both forest-restless states. A capture
finalizes the event and never produces a duplicate Celebi.

## 2026-08-09 — Defer the v0.1 and Phase 2 emulator matrices until the cheat menu

Treat v0.1 as implementation-complete after its clean custom build, static
checks, and reference-ROM comparison pass. Defer the full three-starter
emulator matrix until the optional cheat/debug menu is implemented, then run
the v0.1, Phase 2, and cheat-menu acceptance checks together.

Build and source-level validation are still required while work continues.
Do not describe v0.1 or Phase 2 as playtest-certified or release-ready until the
deferred matrices have passed.
